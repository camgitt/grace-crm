## What is GRACE?

**GRACE** stands for:

| Letter | Meaning | Feature |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **G** | Growth | Track congregation growth and visitor conversion |
| **R** | Relationships | Manage member profiles, families, and interactions |
| **A** | Attendance | Monitor service and event attendance patterns |
| **C** | Community | Small groups, prayer requests, and fellowship |
| **E** | Engagement | Follow-ups, tasks, and care management |

---

## Why GRACE?

**The Problem:** 82% of first-time church visitors never come back. Most churches have no systematic follow-up process—they rely on memory, sticky notes, or spreadsheets that get forgotten by Tuesday.

**The Solution:** GRACE is a simple, affordable CRM that automates visitor follow-up and helps small-to-midsize churches (50-500 members) build lasting relationships with their community.

### What Makes GRACE Different

| Feature | GRACE | Legacy Church Software |
|---------|-------|------------------------|
| **Setup Time** | 5 minutes | Hours/Days |
| **Learning Curve** | Intuitive | Training required |
| **Price** | $29-149/mo | $75-400+/mo |
| **Focus** | Visitor follow-up | Everything (overwhelming) |
| **Mobile-First** | Yes | Often an afterthought |
